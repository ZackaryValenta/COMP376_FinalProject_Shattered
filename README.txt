SHATTERED

Welcome to our shattered segmented world.
You take on the role of Jisan, our main character who is on a quest to take down the evil Duck boss in the shadow realm.
You must navigate through the world kicking birds' butts in order to collect enough powerups to get through to the next area.

CONTROLS:

Left - Left arrow
Right - Right arrow
Jump - Space
Double jump - Space twice (only once received as powerup)
Kick - F
Spin kick - E (only once received as powerup)


POWERUPS
The Healthy Hamburger gives you the strength to perform a spin kick.
The Golden Star allows Jisan to jump while already in the air. Hit the jump button in quick succession to get a more powerful double jump.


HINTS:
1.
Some jumps are hard to make and might take a couple of attempts, it's worthwhile to stand at the edge of the platform, jump first and then guide Jisan through the air for difficult jumps.

2.
It might not be so obvious where you have to proceed to, the world is yours to explore. If there is an area that you don't have the ability to get to then chances are once you have unlocked some powerups you will be able to "ascend" to where you want to be ;)
